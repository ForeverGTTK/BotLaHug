            <p>
                Hello! I'm a 29-year-old Python developer and a third-year student at the Israel Academic College in Ramat Gan, pursuing a degree in software development. Alongside my studies, I serve as a vice battery commander in the reserves. BotLaHug was created as part of my final project to help sports clubs and organizations streamline their operations through a user-friendly platform.
